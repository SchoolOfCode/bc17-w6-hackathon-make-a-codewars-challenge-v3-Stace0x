A friend is planning a last minuite dinner party and needs you to go to the shops on your way home, they told you the shopping list but need to know if the store has the items and how many
return an object with this format

        count: matchCount,
        items: matches

If the stores intentory and your list are exacty the same message "We all good" and if none of the items match you will need to message back with "We have a problem".
